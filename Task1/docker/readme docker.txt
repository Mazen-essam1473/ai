as we all know on the stage of deployment of our code we may have some
issus like the difference of operating systems and this may cuz a huge 
amount of time and money to fix we can use virtual servers or machines
to fix the problem but it leades to a a huge over load and makes our 
application to be so slow so use some thing called dockers it make the 
same but instead of virtuallizing hardware it only virtuallize the os
so all apps are run in a single kernel and this makes almost every thing 
more faster and more efficient
