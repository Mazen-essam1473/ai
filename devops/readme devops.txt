first lets talk about dveops this is a method of improving our code at the 
begaining of a new code after writing it we need to test it and the code 
that fails we try improving it then and after we test and pass we begain 
to deploy it on some thing like githup we need then to track and changes 
do any improvements and this by monotiring it. 
second devops is a way to integrate the team also by each other developers
and operation team in order to improve the collapration and productivity 
in the team and the company and this happenes by automating infrastructure
automating work flows and monitoring the applcation and making sure of its
performance and trying to improve it .
using devops will allow them to improve the time of productivity and 
writting code as it will save them alot of time .
so the benefits of devops are:1- faster in doing projects and code so 
better performance
2- more focus on improving the bussiness 
3- improve the time mangment so as it saves us alot of time.
